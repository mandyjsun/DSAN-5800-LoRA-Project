It uses a helper function `is_even_xor` to check if a number has an even xor. The function uses a set to remove duplicates and makes lookup faster. For each unique number, it checks if it has an even xor by using the `is_even_xor` function. If the number has an even xor, it finds the pair with that number as xor and increments the count. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list."}

The function iterates through the array and updates the `major` and `count` accordingly. If the count of an element becomes negative, it means that the previous majority element was incorrect, so the function updates the `major` with the current element and resets the count to 1. If the count of an element is 0, it means that the current element is not the majority element, so the function updates the `major` with the current element and resets the count to 1. If the count of an element is positive, it means that the current element is still the majority element, so the function just increments the count. At the end of the function, the `major` variable will contain the majority element.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input array is sorted.

The minimum side length is then checked to ensure it is a positive number. If not, a `ValueError` is raised. Finally, the function calculates and returns the volume of the cuboid (`side_length ** 3`)."}
